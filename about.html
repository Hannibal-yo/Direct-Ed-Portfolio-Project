<h2>Why Programming in Direct-Ed</h2>
<p> I joined the Direct Ed programming and web development bootcamp because I wanted to immerse myself in a learning environment that is as dynamic and forward-thinking as the tech industry itself. The bootcampâ€™s hands-on approach and industry-relevant curriculum promised a fast track to acquiring the skills necessary to not only participate in but also innovate within the digital landscape. It was an opportunity to be surrounded by like-minded individuals and mentors who are just as passionate about technology, which I knew would be instrumental in my growth as a developer and as a contributor to the future of web technologies.</p>
